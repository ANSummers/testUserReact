# Solution by Abbie Summers

## Project Description

- Using a Sqlite database with sequelize as the ORM.
- Implemented routes to view, list, and create users.

- created components for a homepage, user dashboard, and add user. A Search page was also created for future implementation.
- Common layout was created for universal styling and navigation bar functions.
- Basic styling with color palette chosen to minimize eye strain.

## Future

- Error handling for common failure modes, such as database connection time-out
- User input validation
- User search functionality
- User Deletion
- Edit users
- Date picker as a more user friendly way to accept user birthdays
- Improved styling for tables and forms

## Lessons Learned

- Database and ORM aspects were a challenge. Typically I focus on the frontend and this required additional research
- Improved at troubleshooting more complex browser errors
